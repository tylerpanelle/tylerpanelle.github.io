# Build Practical Linux Server Skills with the Upskill Challenge

*This content is based on the [Linux Upskill Challenge](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/), a free and open-source project designed to teach practical Linux server management skills. I'll be using this resource for my own learning and adapting its lessons for my website posts.*

**Get hands-on experience managing a remote Linux server from the command line.**

The Linux Upskill Challenge is a month-long journey for anyone aiming to break into Linux-related roles—whether that’s a junior sysadmin, a DevOps position, or something similar. This course dives deep into server management and command-line skills but starts from the basics, making it perfect for complete beginners, including those coming from Windows or macOS backgrounds.

> **Completely free** and open source—your only investment is your time!

## Getting Started

Begin by reviewing the [FAQ](#faq) to get a solid understanding of how the challenge works—most common questions are covered there.

If you’re ready to dive in, you’ll need access to an Internet-exposed server. Don’t worry if this sounds daunting—step-by-step guides are provided to help you set one up, often at little to no cost.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Is this course right for me?**  
This course is perfect for aspiring Linux professionals, such as junior sysadmins or DevOps enthusiasts, as well as for Windows admins looking to expand into Linux. It’s also great for anyone wanting to enhance their Linux command-line skills, even if they’re starting from scratch.

**Will this prepare me for Linux certification exams?**

**When does the course start?**  
It begins on the first Monday of each month, with material delivered 

**How much time should I expect to spend?**  
Plan for 1-2 hours per lesson. Early lessons might take less time, but additional “Extension” tasks are available if you want to dive deeper.

**Can I start mid-month?**  
Absolutely! The material is always available, so you can start at your own pace.

**Do I need a cloud-based server?**  
Yes, using a remote server that’s exposed to the internet is essential for the experience. Instructions for setting up a server are provided in the Day 0 lessons. If you prefer to run a local server, you can follow the instructions provided on the [Linux Upskill Challenge website](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/).

**What if I don’t have a credit card for cloud providers?**  
There are alternative options for setting up a server without a credit card, which are covered in the Day 0 lessons.

**Why Ubuntu? Can I use a different Linux distribution?**  
The course is based on Ubuntu Server LTS to keep things straightforward. If you’re comfortable with another distro, feel free to use it, but be prepared to manage any differences on your own.

If you’re using a free-tier VPS, you can leave it running during the course without exceeding thresholds. Just be sure to monitor it.
